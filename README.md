# Face-Hand-Finger-Detection
This project detects human faces and counts the number of fingers raised in real-time using **Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe**. It captures video from a webcam, detects faces by drawing a green bounding box, and tracks hands to count raised fingers, displaying the count on the screen.
